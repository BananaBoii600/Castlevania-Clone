# using a hardcoded value (and this requires loading every single room at runtime at the beginning, 
# which we should avoid for performance reasons anyways), but we also want to leave the possibility
# of "blacklisting" some tiles because they might not be reachable by the player
# Since it doesn't really matter exactly which tiles are blacklisted for
# total count, the total count for "accepted" tiles is sufficient here.
# We leave the heavylifting for finding out how many tiles are in an entire level up to the map tool.
# See map tool in res://tools/map folder for more details on how these numbers might be obtained
