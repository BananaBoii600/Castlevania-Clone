# The Diasporic Crypt
GodotEngine Castlevania-like classic platformer demo

**Note: This project has migrated to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/beelzy/DiasporicCrypt). This project is archived on Github, but you can still download previous releases. We recommend getting the latest source from Gitlab though.**

This game is still in development. It demonstrates what GodotEngine can do. It is modelled after classic retro gaming 2D platformer games like Castlevania SOTN, except with one way platforms, ledge climbing and ladders. It does not make heavy use of the built-in 2D physics engine, so much of the behavior is programmed by hand. Much of that behavior and the algorithms involved are taken from [this guide](http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/comment-page-1/#comments) (use archive.org if the link doesn't work). Read source code comments for implementation specific details.

For a simpler implementation, feel free to use the demo branch.
